# Implementation of Moore and Mealy machines
## I wrote a simple implementation of Moore and Mealy machines in C language for the assignment given in the Automata class.
- According to the table given in the .txt files, I made the states go where they should go with different inputs.
- I used the following table examples in .txt files.
